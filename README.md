The `play-pac4j` project is an **easy and powerful security library for Play framework v2** web applications which supports authentication and authorization, but also application logout and advanced features like CSRF protection.
It's based on Play 2 and on the **[pac4j security engine](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j)**. It's available under the Apache 2 license.

Several versions of the library are available for the different versions of the Play framework:

| Play version | pac4j version | play-pac4j version

**Main concepts and components:**

1) A [**client**](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/wiki/Clients) represents an authentication mechanism (CAS, OAuth, SAML, OpenID Connect, LDAP, JWT...) It performs the login process and returns a user profile. An indirect client is for UI authentication while a direct client is for web services authentication

2) An [**authorizer**](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/wiki/Authorizers) is meant to check authorizations on the authenticated user profile(s) (role / permission, ...) or on the current web context (IP check, CSRF...)

3) A [**config**](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/blob/master/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/config/Config.java) defines the security configuration via clients and authorizers

4) The `Secure` annotation / function or the `SecurityFilter` protects an url by checking that the user is authenticated and that the authorizations are valid, according to the clients and authorizers configuration. If the user is not authenticated, it performs authentication for direct clients or starts the login process for indirect clients

5) The `CallbackController` finishes the login process for an indirect client

6) The `ApplicationLogoutController` logs out the user from the application.

Just follow these easy steps to secure your Play 2 web application:


### 1) Add the required dependencies (`play-pac4j` + `pac4j-*` libraries)

You need to add a dependency on:

- the `play-pac4j` library (<em>groupId</em>: **org.pac4j**, *version*: **2.5.0-SNAPSHOT**)
- the appropriate `pac4j` [submodules](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/wiki/Clients) (<em>groupId</em>: **org.pac4j**, *version*: **1.9.1**): `pac4j-oauth` for OAuth support (Facebook, Twitter...), `pac4j-cas` for CAS support, `pac4j-ldap` for LDAP authentication, etc.

All released artifacts are available in the [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cpac4j).


### 2) Define the configuration (`Config` + `Client` + `Authorizer` + `PlaySessionStore`)

The configuration (`org.pac4j.core.config.Config`) contains all the clients and authorizers required by the application to handle security.

The `Config` is bound for injection in a `SecurityModule` (or whatever the name you call it):

*In Java:*

```java
public class SecurityModule extends AbstractModule {

  @Override
  protected void configure() {  
    bind(PlaySessionStore.class).to(PlayCacheStore.class);
  
    FacebookClient facebookClient = new FacebookClient("fbId", "fbSecret");
    TwitterClient twitterClient = new TwitterClient("twId", "twSecret");

    FormClient formClient = new FormClient(baseUrl + "/loginForm", new SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticator());
    IndirectBasicAuthClient basicAuthClient = new IndirectBasicAuthClient(new SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticator());

    CasClient casClient = new CasClient("http://mycasserver/login");
    casClient.setLogoutHandler(new PlayCacheLogoutHandler(getProvider(CacheApi.class)));

    SAML2ClientConfiguration cfg = new SAML2ClientConfiguration("resource:samlKeystore.jks",
                    "pac4j-demo-passwd", "pac4j-demo-passwd", "resource:openidp-feide.xml");
    cfg.setMaximumAuthenticationLifetime(3600);
    cfg.setServiceProviderEntityId("urn:mace:saml:pac4j.org");
    cfg.setServiceProviderMetadataPath(new File("target", "sp-metadata.xml").getAbsolutePath());
    SAML2Client saml2Client = new SAML2Client(cfg);

    OidcClient oidcClient = new OidcClient();
    oidcClient.setClientID("id");
    oidcClient.setSecret("secret");
    oidcClient.setDiscoveryURI("https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration");
    oidcClient.addCustomParam("prompt", "consent");

    ParameterClient parameterClient = new ParameterClient("token", new JwtAuthenticator("salt"));

    Clients clients = new Clients("http://localhost:9000/callback", facebookClient, twitterClient, formClient,
      basicAuthClient, casClient, saml2Client, oidcClient, parameterClient);

    Config config = new Config(clients);
    config.addAuthorizer("admin", new RequireAnyRoleAuthorizer<>("ROLE_ADMIN"));
    config.addAuthorizer("custom", new CustomAuthorizer());
    config.setHttpActionAdapter(new DemoHttpActionAdapter());
    bind(Config.class).toInstance(config);
  }
}
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
class SecurityModule(environment: Environment, configuration: Configuration) extends AbstractModule {

  override def configure(): Unit = {
  
    bind(classOf[PlaySessionStore]).to(classOf[PlayCacheStore])

    val facebookClient = new FacebookClient("fbId", "fbSecret")
    val twitterClient = new TwitterClient("twId", "twSecret")

    val formClient = new FormClient(baseUrl + "/loginForm", new SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticator())
    val basicAuthClient = new IndirectBasicAuthClient(new SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticator())

    val casClient = new CasClient("http://mycasserver/login")
    casClient.setLogoutHandler(new PlayCacheLogoutHandler(getProvider(classOf[CacheApi])))

    val cfg = new SAML2ClientConfiguration("resource:samlKeystore.jks", "pac4j-demo-passwd", "pac4j-demo-passwd", "resource:openidp-feide.xml")
    cfg.setMaximumAuthenticationLifetime(3600)
    cfg.setServiceProviderEntityId("urn:mace:saml:pac4j.org")
    cfg.setServiceProviderMetadataPath(new File("target", "sp-metadata.xml").getAbsolutePath())
    val saml2Client = new SAML2Client(cfg)

    val oidcClient = new OidcClient()
    oidcClient.setClientID("id")
    oidcClient.setSecret("secret")
    oidcClient.setDiscoveryURI("https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration")
    oidcClient.addCustomParam("prompt", "consent")

    val parameterClient = new ParameterClient("token", new JwtAuthenticator("salt"))

    val clients = new Clients("http://localhost:9000/callback", facebookClient, twitterClient, formClient,
      basicAuthClient, casClient, saml2Client, oidcClient, parameterClient)

    val config = new Config(clients)
    config.addAuthorizer("admin", new RequireAnyRoleAuthorizer[Nothing]("ROLE_ADMIN"))
    config.addAuthorizer("custom", new CustomAuthorizer())
    config.setHttpActionAdapter(new DemoHttpActionAdapter())
    bind(classOf[Config]).toInstance(config)
  }
}
```

`http://localhost:8080/callback` is the url of the callback endpoint, which is only necessary for indirect clients.

Notice that you define a specific `HttpActionAdapter` to handle specific HTTP actions (like redirections, forbidden / unauthorized pages) via the `setHttpActionAdapter` method. The available implementation is the `DefaultHttpActionAdapter`, but you can subclass it to define your own HTTP 401 / 403 error pages for example.


### 3a) Protect urls per Action (`Secure`)

You can protect (authentication + authorizations) the urls of your Play application by using the `Secure` annotation / function. It has the following behaviour:

1) First, if the user is not authenticated (no profile) and if some clients have been defined in the `clients` parameter, a login is tried for the direct clients.

2) Then, if the user has a profile, authorizations are checked according to the `authorizers` configuration. If the authorizations are valid, the user is granted access. Otherwise, a 403 error page is displayed.

3) Finally, if the user is still not authenticated (no profile), he is redirected to the appropriate identity provider if the first defined client is an indirect one in the `clients` configuration. Otherwise, a 401 error page is displayed.


The following parameters are available:

1) `clients` (optional): the list of client names (separated by commas) used for authentication:
- in all cases, this filter requires the user to be authenticated. Thus, if the `clients` is blank or not defined, the user must have been previously authenticated
- if the `client_name` request parameter is provided, only this client (if it exists in the `clients`) is selected.

2) `authorizers` (optional): the list of authorizer names (separated by commas) used to check authorizations:
- if the `authorizers` is blank or not defined, no authorization is checked
- the following authorizers are available by default (without defining them in the configuration):
  * `isFullyAuthenticated` to check if the user is authenticated but not remembered, `isRemembered` for a remembered user, `isAnonymous` to ensure the user is not authenticated, `isAuthenticated` to ensure the user is authenticated (not necessary by default unless you use the `AnonymousClient`)
  * `hsts` to use the `StrictTransportSecurityHeader` authorizer, `nosniff` for `XContentTypeOptionsHeader`, `noframe` for `XFrameOptionsHeader `, `xssprotection` for `XSSProtectionHeader `, `nocache` for `CacheControlHeader ` or `securityHeaders` for the five previous authorizers
  * `csrfToken` to use the `CsrfTokenGeneratorAuthorizer` with the `DefaultCsrfTokenGenerator` (it generates a CSRF token and saves it as the `pac4jCsrfToken` request attribute and in the `pac4jCsrfToken` cookie), `csrfCheck` to check that this previous token has been sent as the `pac4jCsrfToken` header or parameter in a POST request and `csrf` to use both previous authorizers.

3) `multiProfile` (optional): it indicates whether multiple authentications (and thus multiple profiles) must be kept at the same time (`false` by default).


For example in your controllers:

*In Java:*

```java
@Secure(clients = "FacebookClient")
public Result facebookIndex() {
  return protectedIndexView();
}
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
def facebookIndex = Secure("FacebookClient") { profiles =>
 Action { request =>
   Ok(views.html.protectedIndex(profiles))
 }
}
```


### 3b) Protect urls via the `SecurityFilter`

In order to protect multiple urls at the same tine, you can configure the `SecurityFilter`. You need to configure your application to include the `SecurityFilter` as follows:

First define a `Filters` class in your application (if you have not yet done so).

*In Java:*

```java
package filters;

import org.pac4j.play.filters.SecurityFilter;
import play.http.HttpFilters;
import play.api.mvc.EssentialFilter;

import javax.inject.Inject;

public class Filters implements HttpFilters {

  private final SecurityFilter securityFilter;

  @Inject
  public Filters(SecurityFilter securityFilter) {
    this.securityFilter = securityFilter;
  }

  @Override
  public EssentialFilter[] filters() {
    return new EssentialFilter[] {securityFilter};
  }
}
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
package filters

import javax.inject.Inject
import org.pac4j.play.filters.SecurityFilter
import play.api.http.HttpFilters

/**
  * Configuration of all the Play filters that are used in the application.
  */
class Filters @Inject()(securityFilter: SecurityFilter) extends HttpFilters {

  def filters = Seq(securityFilter)

}
```

Then tell your application to use the filters in `application.conf`:

    play.http.filters = "filters.Filters"

See for more information on the use of filters in Play the [Play documentation on Filters](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaHttpFilters).

Rules for the security filter can be supplied in application.conf. An example is shown below. It
consists of a list of filter rules, where the key is a regular expression that will be used to
match the url. Make sure that the / is escaped by \\ to make a valid regular expression.

For each regex key, there are two subkeys: `authorizers` and `clients`. Here you can define the
correct values, like you would supply to the `RequireAuthentication` method in controllers. There
two exceptions: `authorizers` can have two special values: `_authenticated_` and `_anonymous_`.

`_anonymous_` will disable authentication and authorization for urls matching the regex.
`_authenticated_` will require authentication, but will set clients and authorizers both to `null`.

Rules are applied top to bottom. The first matching rule will define which clients and authorizers
are used. When not provided, the value will be `null`.

    pac4j.security.rules = [
      # Admin pages need a special authorizer and do not support login via Twitter.
      {"/admin/.*" = {
        authorizers = "admin"
        clients = "FormClient"
      }}
      # Rules for the REST services. These don't specify a client and will return 401
      # when not authenticated.
      {"/restservices/.*" = {
        authorizers = "_authenticated_"
      }}
      # The login page needs to be publicly accessible.
      {"/login.html" = {
        authorizers = "_anonymous_"
      }}
      # 'Catch all' rule to make sure the whole application stays secure.
      {".*" = {
        authorizers = "_authenticated_"
        clients = "FormClient,TwitterClient"
      }}
    ]


### 4) Define the callback endpoint only for indirect clients (`CallbackController`)

For indirect clients (like Facebook), the user is redirected to an external identity provider for login and then back to the application.
Thus, a callback endpoint is required in the application. It is managed by the `CallbackController` which has the following behaviour:

1) the credentials are extracted from the current request to fetch the user profile (from the identity provider) which is then saved in the web session

2) finally, the user is redirected back to the originally requested url (or to the `defaultUrl`).


The following parameters are available:

1) `defaultUrl` (optional): it's the default url after login if no url was originally requested (`/` by default)

2) `multiProfile` (optional): it indicates whether multiple authentications (and thus multiple profiles) must be kept at the same time (`false` by default).


In the `routes` file:

```properties
GET    /callback    @org.pac4j.play.CallbackController.callback()
```

In the `SecurityModule`:

*In Java:*

```java
CallbackController callbackController = new CallbackController();
callbackController.setDefaultUrl("/");
bind(CallbackController.class).toInstance(callbackController);
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
val callbackController = new CallbackController()
callbackController.setDefaultUrl("/")
bind(classOf[CallbackController]).toInstance(callbackController)
```


### 5) Get the user profile (`ProfileManager`)

You can get the profile of the authenticated user using `profileManager.get(true)` (`false` not to use the session, but only the current HTTP request).
You can test if the user is authenticated using `profileManager.isAuthenticated()`.
You can get all the profiles of the authenticated user (if ever multiple ones are kept) using `profileManager.getAll(true)`.

Examples:

*In Java:*

```java
public class Application {

    @Inject
    protected PlaySessionStore playSessionStore;  

    public Result getUserProfile() {
        PlayWebContext webContext = new PlayWebContext(ctx(), playSessionStore)
        ProfileManager<CommonProfile> profileManager = new ProfileManager(context);
        Optional<CommonProfile> profile = profileManager.get(true);
        ....
    } 

}
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
class Application @Inject()(sessionStore: PlaySessionStore) extends Controller {

    def getUserProfile() = Action { request =>
        val webContext = new PlayWebContext(request, playSessionStore)
        val profileManager = new ProfileManager[CommonProfile](webContext)
        val profile = profileManager.get(true)
        ....
    }
}
```

The retrieved profile is at least a `CommonProfile`, from which you can retrieve the most common attributes that all profiles share. But you can also cast the user profile to the appropriate profile according to the provider used for authentication. For example, after a Facebook authentication:

*In Java:*

```java
FacebookProfile facebookProfile = (FacebookProfile) commonProfile;
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
val facebookProfile = commonProfile.asInstanceOf[FacebookProfile]
```


### 6) Logout (`ApplicationLogoutController`)

You can log out the current authenticated user using the `ApplicationLogoutController`. It has the following behaviour:

1) after logout, the user is redirected to the url defined by the `url` request parameter if it matches the `logoutUrlPattern`

2) or the user is redirected to the `defaultUrl` if it is defined

3) otherwise, a blank page is displayed.


The following parameters are available:

1) `defaultUrl` (optional): the default logout url if no `url` request parameter is provided or if the `url` does not match the `logoutUrlPattern` (not defined by default)

2) `logoutUrlPattern` (optional): the logout url pattern that the `url` parameter must match (only relative urls are allowed by default).


In the `routes` file:

```properties
GET     /logout     @org.pac4j.play.ApplicationLogoutController.logout()
```

In the `SecurityModule`:

*In Java:*

```java
ApplicationLogoutController logoutController = new ApplicationLogoutController();
logoutController.setDefaultUrl("/");
bind(ApplicationLogoutController.class).toInstance(logoutController);
```

*In Scala:*

```scala
val logoutController = new ApplicationLogoutController()
logoutController.setDefaultUrl("/")
bind(classOf[ApplicationLogoutController]).toInstance(logoutController)
```


## Migration guide

### 2.4.0 (Play 2.5) -> 2.5.0 (Play 2.5)

The `SecurityModule` class needs to bind the `PlaySessionStore` to the `PlayCacheStore`.

The `PlayWebContext` needs a `PlaySessionStore`, see examples at heading 5 (Get the user profile (`ProfileManager`)).

### 2.1.0 (Play 2.4) / 2.2.0 (Play 2.5) -> 2.3.0 (Play 2.4) / 2.4.0 (Play 2.5)

The `RequiresAuthentication` annotation and function have been renamed as `Secure` with the `clients` and `authorizers` parameters (instead of `clientName` and `authorizerName`).

The `UserProfileController` class and the `getUserProfile` method in the `Security`  trait no longer exist and the `ProfileManager` must be used instead.

The `ApplicationLogoutController` behaviour has slightly changed: even without any `url` request parameter, the user will be redirected to the `defaultUrl` if it has been defined

### 2.0.1 -> 2.1.0

The separate Scala and Java projects have been merged. You need to change the dependency `play-pac4j-java` or `play-pac4j-scala` to simply `play-pac4j`.

The `getUserProfile` method of the `Security` trait returns a `Option[CommonProfile]` instead of just a `UserProfile`.

### 2.0.0 -> 2.0.1

The `DataStore` concept is replaced by the pac4j `SessionStore` concept. The `PlayCacheStore` does no longer need to be bound in the security module. A new session store could be defined using the `config.setSessionStore` method.

The `DefaultHttpActionAdapter` does not need to be bound in the security module, but must to be set using the `config.setHttpActionAdapter` method.
